## Contributing to Snapdragon™ Game Super Resolution

Hi there!
We’re thrilled that you’d like to contribute to this project.
Your help is essential for keeping this project great and for making it better.

## Branching Strategy

In general, contributors should develop on branches based off of `main` and pull requests should be made against `main`.

## Submitting a pull request

1. Please read our [code of conduct](CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md) and [license](LICENSE).
2. [Fork](https://github.com/quic/snapdragon-gsr) and clone the repository.
3. Create a new branch based on `main`: `git checkout -b <my-branch-name> main`.
4. Make your changes, add tests, and make sure the tests still pass.
5. Commit your changes using the [DCO](http://developercertificate.org/). You can attest to the DCO by commiting with the **-s** or **--signoff** options or manually adding the "Signed-off-by".
6. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/quic/snapdragon-gsr) from your branch to `main`.
7. Pat yourself on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request to be accepted:

- Keep your change as focused as possible.
  If you want to make multiple independent changes, please consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
- Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
